**hey there!** \
**this is irvin, and welcome to aperture ——** _the lens of a 19 yo koinophobic studying at iit madras._ \

the name '_aperture_' represents the field of view of the lens i view the world with. 
and my life's goal? - to just keep explanding this aperture, _**expanding those horizons, conquering it all.**_ \
so here is where you'll find ***me*** - my passions, my ideas and my cathartic & creative releases.
