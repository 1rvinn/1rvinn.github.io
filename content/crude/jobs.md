> “Steve was a wizard, he would be casting spells, and I’d be seeing people get mesmerized” <br><br> ~ Bill Gates on Steven Paul Jobs



Calling Steve Jobs an ‘innovator’, a ‘great marketing mind’, or a ‘sharp entrepreneur’ would be an understatement. Because his abilities were nothing short of superpowers — Jobs could change reality.

Reading Isaacson’s biography of Jobs and taking a deep dive into the infinite ocean of movies, shows, and articles about Apple exposed me to the genius of Mac’s godfather. One characteristic that stuck out to me was Steve’s Reality Distortion Field. Coining the term, Bud Tribble — an early employee at Apple, described Steve’s ability to bend the realities of those around him. The ability to convince others to believe almost anything, thanks to his charm, charisma, and marketing acumen. It was said he could distort his co-workers’ sense of difficulty and make them believe that whatever impossible task they had at hand was possible.
‘In his presence, reality is malleable. He can convince anyone of practically anything.’


Jobs undoubtedly was a great visionary, envisioning products way ahead of time — be it the Mac, iPod or iPhone. Yet, his greatest skill lay in convincing people that his vision was not just a predictive idea but a true reflection of the future. His enchanting keynote sessions, also referred to as Stevenotes, are a testament to this. Be it convincing millions to pay $900 extra for the first Mac because ‘app windows must have rounded corners’ or convincing that headphone jacks are unnecessary, he could bend others’ realities to align with his vision. Now, this is aura!
