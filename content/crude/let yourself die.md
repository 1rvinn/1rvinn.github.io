let yourself die.

for when you live you have to ply

by societal constructs, and cry

the confirmist wry.

let the sense of self die,

and no longer youâ€™re a node in the society;

the chains are all set free;

eternal freedom is bestowed,

and you can fly to where you want to be.

attain freedom hereby,

let yourself die.
