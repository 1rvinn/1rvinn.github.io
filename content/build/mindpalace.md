> **the idea:**
> the user should be able to input pdf(s) which get converted into mindmaps for easy learning. the same should be done for github repos. in addition, there should be an llm to ask questions. \
useful for neurodiverse people; facilitates better learning for them

**inspirations:**
<details>
<summary>  1. docagram </summary>
    
creates flow-chart summaries from web pages

flow:
![image.png](/img/build/mindpalace/image.png)

- takes in data from web page sections
- creates a summary of each of those sections
- generates relationships between parts of the section
- has 2 versions -
    - w/o gemini: uses summarizer api and prompt api for the 2 tasks respectively
    - w/ gemini

example:

- content:
    
    ![image.png](/img/build/mindpalace/image%201.png)
    
- summary:
    
    ![image.png](/img/build/mindpalace/image%202.png)
    
- summary v2 (used to generate the graph)
    
    ![image.png](/img/build/mindpalace/image%203.png)
    
- graph/mermaid diagram:
    
    ![image.png](/img/build/mindpalace/image%204.png)
    
    a shaded box displays the relationship, the unfilled boxes are entities
    
- gemini result
    
    ![image.png](/img/build/mindpalace/image%205.png)
    
- also have the ability to display all graphs together, can choose specific entitites to show as well if someone wants to learn topic wise

**19/02/25 initial plan:**
<div style='text-align:center;'>
    {{< mermaid >}}

    flowchart TD
        A[document]--->|segmentor|B[segments of data]--->|summarizer|D[summarized segments of data]--->|relationship determiner|E[mermaid diagram]
        A--->C[rag]--->F[llm]
        D--->E
    {{< /mermaid >}}
</div>

// want to create it on streamlit since minimal ui, simpler coding


> **update 1 (19/2/25):**
> - i feel like i should pivot this towards github. a tool that facilitates understanding of complex repos through mindmap generation and llm integration
>   - for github repo, i need to parse the contents into an llm acceptable format. there are tools doing that already. i am not sure whether to use them/their apis or develop it completely on my own.
>       - one of the ideas i came across recently was that of [entelligence.ai](https://www.entelligence.ai/explore) - they take in repos, integrate an llm, provide documentation and flow diagram.
>           - the llm responses are really good - looks finetuned (??)
>
> - maybe have both options - github and documents
>   - multimodal support is crucial - it should be able to take in documents, pictures,

reading & trying out stuff
-------

**(1) should i use beautiful soup to scrap github repo data? prolly not gonna work but never used it so lemme try it out once.** 

<details>
<summary>trying out beautiful soup </summary>
    
    (referring to https://medium.com/@elle.neal_71064/mind-mapping-with-ai-an-accessible-approach-for-neurodiverse-learners-1a74767359ff)

    python code:
    
    ```python
    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    
    def scrape_text(url):
        # Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)
    
        # If the GET request is successful, the status code will be 200
        if response.status_code == 200:
            # Get the content of the response
            page_content = response.content
    
            # Create a BeautifulSoup object and specify the parser
            soup = BeautifulSoup(page_content, "html.parser")
    
            # Get the text of the soup object
            text = soup.get_text()
    
            # Return the text
            return text
        else:
            return "Failed to scrape the website"
    
    url=input("enter url:")
    text=scrape_text(url)
    print(text)
    ```
    
    returns text in the website.
</details>

- didn't try it on github repos, can make it work somehow, will be hard tho. will look into it later.

**(2) how did this guy make the functionality?**
<details>
<summary>reading this medium article</summary>
https://medium.com/@elle.neal_71064/mind-mapping-with-ai-an-accessible-approach-for-neurodiverse-learners-1a74767359ff
</details>

- theyâ€™ve given the entire *input_text* received after parsing to the model and asked to generate mermaid maps

- i want mine to be better - it should generate summaries and mermaids for each section, determine the relation among the sections and generate a cohesive mermaid also

---

**(3) checking how good chat gpt is with giving mermaid diags**

<details>
<summary> this section's gonna be long, tried out a variety of inputs and prompts</summary>

- asked chatgpt to analyse my repo - via the repo link - and asked to give a mermaid code explaining it
    - output:
        <div style='text-align:center;'>
            {{< mermaid >}}

        </div>
        the output aint bad
        
    - then i used [gitingest](https://gitingest.com/) to get llm ready parseed version of my repo. gave it as context to gpt4o and asked it to give a mermaid code.
        
        prompt: [llm ready parsed info (token length - 4.7k)] given the above description of a repository, write code for a mermaid diagram explaining the same
        
        - output:

        - maybe ask it to give 2 separate diagrams for directory structure and code logic.

- the outputs were sub standard despite using a sota model - 4o which has a big context window.
- when i use an api, the outputâ€™s quality is bound to degrade.
- the token size is also something that should be taken care of; some repos are excessively big and hence really big token sizes which would be hard to handle.
- therefore, it is of utmost importance to divide the content into sections, provide summaries for each part and then ask the model to create a diagram.
    - need to test this hypothesis

> **getting started with the real shit now**
        
**code to get llm ready parsed github data**
- using requests and base 64, got the following code running that prints the contents of a github repo given its name and the ownerâ€™s name. uses github api for it.
    
    ```python
    import requests
    import base64
    
    # GitHub repository details 
    BASE_URL = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/contents"
    
    def fetch_repo_contents(path=""):
        """Recursively fetches all files in the GitHub repository."""
        url = f"{BASE_URL}/{path}" if path else BASE_URL
        headers = {"Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}"} if GITHUB_TOKEN else {}
        
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()
        else:
            print(f"Error fetching {url}: {response.status_code}")
            return None
    
    def get_file_content(file_url):
        """Fetches and decodes the content of a file from GitHub."""
        headers = {"Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}"} if GITHUB_TOKEN else {}
        
        response = requests.get(file_url, headers=headers)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            file_data = response.json()
            if file_data.get("content"):
                content = base64.b64decode(file_data["content"]).decode("utf-8", errors="ignore")
                return content
        else:
            print(f"Error fetching file content: {response.status_code}")
        
        return None
    
    def traverse_repo(path=""):
        """Recursively traverses the GitHub repository and prints file contents."""
        items = fetch_repo_contents(path)
    
        if items:
            for item in items:
                if item["type"] == "file":
                    print(f"\nðŸ“„ File: {item['path']}")
                    content = get_file_content(item["url"])
                    print(f"--- START OF {item['name']} ---")
                    print(content[:1000])  # Print first 1000 chars for preview
                    print(f"--- END OF {item['name']} ---\n")
                
                elif item["type"] == "dir":
                    print(f"\nðŸ“‚ Directory: {item['path']}")
                    traverse_repo(item["path"])  # Recursive call for directories

^ need to make the following changes:

- [x]  need to change this to take in a url
    
    must have â€˜https://github.com/â€™ in the beginning - a possible scope of error
    
- [x]  currently, itâ€™s also printing image and hidden files/directoriesâ€™ data, which it should skip
    
    ^ excluded the following extensions:
    
    .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .svg, .ico, .webp, .pdf, .zip, .tar, .gz, .mp4, .mp3, .avi
    
- [x]  need it to also print the structure on top
- [x]  must also print that it has exited a directory
- issue: github api has a limited no. of requests (60) per hour per ip.
    - one request is used per file/directory accessed
    - how to bypass this!!!!!!!
    - **update 10/3/25: lol i just had to pass my github auth token and the no of requests per hour increases from 60 to 5000**
    
- divide it into sections (or files); llm provides a technical summary of each section (or file); then these summaries and the structure is fed into the system to analyse the contents and give a mermaid diagram
- can we integrate rag so that itâ€™s able to refer to specifics within the code for a more detailed diagram.
    
    ^ dont really think this is required, since the mermaid diagram is only aimed at providing a high level summary of how the entire code works.
    
- can have mermaid diagrams per section (or file), then one combining them too
- this kind of ui looks really good. plus if the creation could be animated then would look very cool.

thoughts: i think these final prompts are good.

**combined thing**
- iter1:
    - made a streamlit front end
    - takes in pdfs
    - checks whether an image based pdf or text based
    - uses easyocr and pypdf2 for image and text based pdfs respectively
    - extracted text given to segmentor and summarizer
    - gives topics and summaries, displayed there
    - passed to relationship generator. generates relationships within each thing. prints them
    - one combined relationship generator. topic wise summaries given together, gives the relationships and prints the mermaid diagram
    
    // problems:
    
    - shows syntax error many times
    
    // now need to change it to give the content to relationship generator
    
- iter2: content goes to the relationship generator. the topics are decided on the basis of major topics
- iter3: segments on the basis of titles, gives content to both rel and summarizer
    - change summarize prompt
    - 
- iter4: segments on its own, gives content to both rel and summarizer

there are 4 options available

1. segment and summarize together, ie the model decides the main topics. send topic wise summaries to relationship maker
2. segment on the basis of titles, and then summarize, ie the topics are decided on the basis of how theyâ€™re presented in the doc then send topic wise summaries
3. segment on the basis of titles, send content to summarizer to display summaries. relationship maker also gets content.
4. segment according to what it thinks the major topics are, then send content to summarizer and relationship maker.
    
    
    |  | content to rel | no content to rel |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | titles | iter3 | iter2 |
    | own | iter4 | iter1 |

benefits of extracting titles on its own are that big files get segregated into small topics that are easy to understand.

- failed to generate topics error cuz â€œs, \escape in json, expecting delimiter etc
    - either remove these problem creating elements or donot extract content.

because of the reason listed above, we get rid of iter3, 4. 

now in iter2, 1, i think it is more relevant if we do it file wise for github repos and otherwise for other pdfs.

iter 1 final

- added the functionality to take in github repos
- changed the prompts to be different for pdfs and repos
- need to make the following fixes:
    - syntax error
    - mindmaps not viewable nicely
    - ui/ux changes

**[17/3/25]**

integrated mistralâ€™s ocr

- omg it looks so good, i changed text based pdfs to also go through mistrals ocr

cleaned the code, divided into various files and enabled the functions to be imported from there

- ~~need to make ui changes~~
- ~~need to create .env~~
- ~~run the prompts through chatgpt and get better ones~~
- ~~need to structure json~~
- ~~need to integrate caching~~

---
**[18/3/25]**

- the mermaid diagrams arent being represented nicely, theyâ€™re usually being cut off at the bottom unless i make the container size atypically large, which makes it very out of place.
    - tried numerous work arounds, nothing seemed to work
    - then randomly came across a python library that helps to display mermaid code in streamlit and it worked like a charm
- trying to get better prompts
    - explained the pipeline to chatgpt, gave current prompts and asked it to generate newer and more precise ones
- ~~need to improve the colour scheme~~
- made prompt changes, ui changes, looks really cool. just need to integrate rag now.

[Project-WebSage](https://github.com/AIAnytime/Project-WebSage)

^ rag based llm integration for website search

**[26/3/25]**

- deployed on streamlit
- looks so fking good; i can access it through my phone, any of my browsers, literally anywhere and the best part is taht it comes with batteries included- no need to put any api keys <333
- fixes
    - ~~api keys should be locally sourced~~
    - ~~the embeddings stay the same despite a new repo been given~~
    - ~~the embeddings remain same across different devices - the same repo was being referred to on my phone for llm chat despite a different pdf that i had entered initially.~~
        - changed such that new embeddings are generated each time a file is given
    - ~~still shows the CachedWidgetWarning~~
        - put the widget generate outside the cached function
    - syntax error
    - ~~not loading ask ai for pdfs~~
        - fixed it by resetting variables whenever the input mode is changed
    - update readme

---

**[27/3/25]**

- ~~minor fixes~~
    - [x]  change size of chat dialog
    - [x]  change k factor
    - [x]  change prompt to ignore useless files

> **finally. its all done. finally. got it ready. up and running, up and running beautifully. on the web. anybody from any corner of the world can use it anywhere at any corner of the world. no need for api keys, no need for downloads. just one click and you enter your mindpalace.**

launched it on linkedin. put it on a bunch of subreddits and also on hacker news. got a bunch of positive reviews, including those from my close friends. (added more on my learnings from mindpalace in the 9/4/25 blog [here.](https://1rvinn.github.io/crude/090425))

**update [8/4/25]:** \
\
on a friend's feedback, i added the functionality of saving the mindmaps as images. used the [kroki](https://kroki.io/) api endpoint to convert mermaid code into pngs and made them available for download.
