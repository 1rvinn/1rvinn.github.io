      <description>&lt;p&gt;having gained some knowhow of network security, i thought it was time to do some cool shit — let the hacking begin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i came across a video by network chuck on sniffing packets, by executing what is known as a man in the middle attack, and decided to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mitm allows us to sniff all network packets being sent from a device to the router and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;essentially, how this attack works is by bluffing your router into believing that your (the hacker’s) device is the target device and the target device into believing that your (the hacker’s) device is the router. this happens through arp (address resolution protocol) poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;mitm allows us to sniff all network packets being sent from a device to the router and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;essentially, how this attack works is by bluffing your router into believing that your (the hacker’s) device is the target device and the target device into believing that your (the hacker’s) device is the router. this happens through arp (address resolution protocol) poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#39;text-align:center;&#39;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;mermaid&#34;&gt;
flowchart LR
A[&#34;router&#34;]---&gt;|&#34;packet&#34;|B[&#34;your device&#34;]---&gt;|&#34;packet&#34;|C[&#34;target device&#34;]
C[&#34;target device&#34;]---&gt;|&#34;packet&#34;|B[&#34;your device&#34;]---&gt;|&#34;packet&#34;|A[&#34;router&#34;]
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so now, every packet that was supposed to be sent to the router to be further forwarded to the internet now firstly goes through your device which then forwards it to the router to be sent further, and everything coming from the internet through the router firstly enters your device and then is forwarded to the target device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;executing it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i need three major tools for this -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nmap: for fixing my crosshair on the target — analysing the network and identifying the connected devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ettercap: for executing arp poisioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wireshark: for analysing the packets being exchanged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;getting my private ip -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ran ifconfig, got a huge response, out of which the ‘en0’ part is important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why en0? because that is used to refer to your wifi interface (en1 is used for lan)(generally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what can we gauge out of this? -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ether&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%201.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is my device’s mac address&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inet6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%202.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is my local ipv6 address&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%203.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this gives a bunch of information. 192.168.1.6 is my local ipv4 address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0xffffff00 is the netmask, which is in hex format. we’ll convert this into the 8bit format. since one hex character is 4 bit (0 to 2^4-1), we divide the hex into groups of 2 to get - ff ff ff 00, which when converted gives 255.255.255.0 - this implies that the first &lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt; bits are for the network and the last 8 for devices - .0 to .255&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;further .255 is the broadcast address, which means anything directed to .255 is broadcasted to all devices connected to the network. // can some attack happen via this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since .0 is reserved for the network id and .255 for broadcast, .1-.254 can be occupied by devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now, how do we get the network subnet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the whole ip network - 192.168.0.0/16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a subnet - 192.168.1.0/24&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a device - 192.168.1.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// the part after ‘/’ implies the number of bits saved for the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so our subnet is 192.168.1.0/24&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enumeration -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ran the follwoing nmap command to view a list of devices connected to my network and list the open/closed ports associated with that device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo nmap -sN &amp;lt;subnet_for_my_home_network&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;the flag -sN implies a stealth TCP null scan, ie, it does not use standard TCP flags like SYN, ACK. if the response is none that implies that the port is open. in case the response is RST(reset), it implies that the port is closed. why? because tcp’s rfc says that if a packet does not match the existing connection and does not have a header like SYN or FIN then the system should respond with an RST if the port is closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i got the following response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/Screenshot_2025-05-26_at_15.07.10.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot 2025-05-26 at 15.07.10.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this gives me the ip addresses and mac ids of the devices connected on my network&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// on further reading, i understood that a no response doesn’t always necessarily imply that the port is open, it might as well be being blocked by a firewall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// i also got to know that i can get the list of devices through the ‘-sn’ flag than the ‘-sN’ flag. the key differences b/w -sn and -sN are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-sn does a device scan through icmp echo requests (ping), does not scan ports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-sN scans ports by sending tcp null requests, we get the device info along with port info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so then i ran this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo nmap -sn &amp;lt;subnet_for_my_home_network&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;got the following response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%204.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this gives all the devices connected to my network. .9 is my phone (iphone also specified in the previous response), .7 my alexa (says amazon technologies) and .6 is my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what’s weird is that other devices connected to my network are not being displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;^^ need to look into this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let’s attack my phone — ipv4: 192.168.1.9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;executing the attack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well executing it is pretty chill, all i have to do is run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo ettercap -T -S -i en0 -M arp:remote /192.168.1.1// /192.168.1.9//
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;well that’s a very long one, here’s what it all means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-T&lt;/strong&gt;: for text only interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-S&lt;/strong&gt;: for sm shi i didnt understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-i&lt;/strong&gt;: for specifying the interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-M&lt;/strong&gt;: for man in the middle attacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;arp:remote /&lt;ip1&gt;// /&lt;ip2&gt;//&lt;/strong&gt;: arp signifies that it must be done via arp spoofing, ip1 is the router’s ip and ip2 the target device’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here is what happened after that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%205.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%206.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// this is definitely something i couldnt make sense of so i opened it on wireshark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sniffing the packets via wireshark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;opened wireshark, opened the ‘eth0’ interface, and applied the following filter to see traffic coming in/going out from my phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%207.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i opened &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com&#34;&gt;www.youtube.com&lt;/a&gt; on my phone and saw packets being exchanged with 172.217.166.14 which on lookup turned out to be google’s server. the application data was ofc encrypted and i couldnt figure out what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%208.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%209.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then i tried a few different websites like &lt;a href=&#34;http://amazon.in&#34;&gt;amazon.in&lt;/a&gt; which interacted with a no. of ips all of which belonged to amazon web services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but this isnt going to let me find out what exact websites the target is going to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;provided, they are secured. in case they arent, ie, in the case of http websites (i visited &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.testingmcafeesites.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.testingmcafeesites.com&lt;/a&gt;), you can directly see the application data being transferred in plain text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i added the following filter to see only http protocol packets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%2010.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then followed the http stream of the latest one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/e938b04f-1de0-4544-af88-44fa6fba3905.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and got this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%2011.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;^^ this essentially gives away the entire response being returned from the site in plain text. this is why http isnt secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another way to get to know about the websites being visited is by looking at the dns requests. i updated the filter to only view dns requests and visited instagram, my personal webpage, and - uhm - a little questionable site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%2012.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then i visited patrick collisions &lt;a href=&#34;https://patrickcollison.com/advice&#34;&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; and that too is visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%2013.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well yea, i guess that’s it for mitm attacks. very fun, but would’ve been better if i’d’ve executed it on a different device than my own phone. will figure out why nmap’s not showing other devices and see what could be done to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;update-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i found a better way to do this and that is by using bettercap. just the commands used change, the basic principles remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s no need for nmap now as bettercap itself can show me the devices connected to my router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo bettercap —&amp;gt; net.probe on —&amp;gt; net.show&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%2014.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/build/mitm_attacks/image%2015.png&#34; alt=&#34;image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then go over to wireshark to analyse the packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lol i just intercepted my dad’s computer&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>project proposal - federated learning</title>
      <link>https://1rvinn.github.io/crude/project-proposal---federated-learning/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this project aims at exploring a novel framework for training neural networks - federated learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;brief-about-federated-learning&#34;&gt;brief about federated learning:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;traditionally, local availability of training data has been an important pre-requisite for training ml models. however, this methodology has a variety of road blocks associated with it. the prime ones being lack of democratisation in model creation and lower development in fields with sensitive data like finance and healthcare. federated learning aims to solve these challenges by introducing an alternate way of training models - instead of data travelling to the model and the model getting trained, the model travels to data sources (silos, personal devices), gets trained and publishes the updates back to the central model.
this enhances the privacy of ai based systems since the data has to never leave the device. furthermore, this means that people can have full control of their data and yet contirbute tot he development of ai, ie, now proprietary and sensitive data can also be used for training (both pre and post) purposes. this solves the problem of only big data companies being able to train big models, thus leading to more democratization in the field. secondly, it also promotes ai developments in the sensitive data fields like finance and healthcare, which traditionally have been underdeveloped due to privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;working of neural nets [A]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comparision between traditionally trained nets vs FL trained ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;networking between devices and a central server [S]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;privacy preserving methodologies and the mathematics involved [S]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A - ai focused topics, S - security focused topics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current applications in the industry, future prospects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start off by implementing it on ml models, using already existing frameworks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://flower.ai/&#34;&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.nvidia.com/flare&#34;&gt;nvidia flare&lt;/a&gt; [2 weeks]
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understanding the library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implement on a basic ml model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delving deeper
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understanding fl in greater detail [3 months]
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comprehensively understand the maths behind it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exploring different training methods like FedAvg, FedSGD etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;security considerations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;secure aggregation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;differential privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;homomorphic encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modeling federated learning from scratch
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coding the process from scratch, including all the above stated steps (&amp;lsquo;key steps involved&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implementing &amp;gt;=1 privacy preserving strategies (secure agg, diff priv., homo enc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;facilitating networking between edge devices and a central server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implementation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implement on the following networks (subject to change on the basis of our findings above): [3 months]
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNNs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09943&#34;&gt;SLMs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implement using existing libraries first [to be displayed in RC] and later from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compare their accuracies with that of normally trained neural nets [to be displayed in RC]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look into fine-tuning llms for particular tasks using FL
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05976&#34;&gt;FLoRA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00875&#34;&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00875&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this could be one of the first steps towards making specialised chatbots (possibly even agents) trained on personal private data (great financial use case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;further improvements
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coming up with solutions to the bottlenecks identified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few unique approaches include
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alphaxiv.org/abs/2209.06359v1&#34;&gt;federated pruning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03448&#34;&gt;federated reconstruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;federated dropout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;future prospects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publishing our own library for federated learning - simplifying tasks like secure aggregation, differential privacy etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an api based federated learning model which people can opt into for training
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eg:  small financial institutions can opt-in to train anti-fraud or loan default prediction models collaboratively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hospitals signing up to develop privacy preserving diagnostic models. &lt;a href=&#34;https://aibusiness.com/verticals/intel-and-upenn-to-use-federated-ai-for-privacy-preserving-brain-tumor-research#:~:text=Instead%20of%20moving%20data%20to,into%20a%20single%2C%20larger%20model&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating an agent specialized for a particular task - financial analysis, tax filing agents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;^ requires collaborations with financial institutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recently, while reading about the recent developments in the field i realised an array of issues that, in my opinion, are being overlooked in the current paradigm:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;monopolisation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Due to the humongous data requirement for pre-training, we see big-data companies like the &amp;lsquo;Googles&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Microsofts&amp;rsquo; of the world having an unfair competitive edge over other smaller corporations or entities in developing such models. This not only means a handful of companies have control over such a quintessential field but also implies:
&lt;br&gt;
[D] soft power - greater soft power over all AI-based content, which could further transcend into propagating bias through content and controlling widespread opinions about sensitive topics across the entire world.
&lt;br&gt;
[P] access to user data - with the advent of time, as AI becomes an indispensable part of our lives, these handful corporations will have even greater access to user data across different use cases, making them even more powerful. Not only this but these days, the most popular LLMs use consumer data for further training, while only mentioning this very subtly in their privacy policy. This makes room for a plethora of data security leaks on the cloud where this data is hosted and other data attacks such as prompt injection.
&lt;br&gt;
[D] by virtue of huge data and state-of-the-art compute requirements, it is only the firms with a rich history in tech and high levels of disposable income to spend, who can establish themselves in this area, making it discriminatorily hard for smaller firms to emerge in this field. This also means a geopolitical issue for 2nd and 3rd world countries being completely dependent upon the 1st world for such foundational models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;climate impact&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
[D] these foundational models require huge loads of compute requirements for pre-training. This means great amounts of energy requirements, so much so that companies like Microsoft have rented complete nuclear reactors to satisfy the energy hunger of their AI programmes. This move is completely counterintuitive to the sustainability efforts being done to reverse climate change.
&lt;br&gt;
[S] this tradeoff, considering the first set of harms [1] as well, is completely unjustified and will only lead humanity to its doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;low Levels of Development in the essential fields of Healthcare and Finance&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
[P] since these models require unrestricted access to data to be trained, coupled with the issue that healthcare and financial data being highly private, we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen any major breakthroughs in these areas. AI has immense potential to change the lives of millions provided there is enough sustainable development in these fields, but the only thing that is holding us back is access to highly private data which is a justified concern given the first set of issues [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with all these concerns in mind, I came across this interesting framework called Federated Learning. coupled with a very interesting encryption scheme - homomorphic encryption - it can solve all the above-listed problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;federated learning:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
In the current paradigm, the data travels to the model, and the model is trained. But what if the model travels to the data for training? That is, there is no transfer of data, therefore no room for data leaks, privacy issues and greater accessibility for smaller companies without data to compete with big giants.
&lt;br&gt;
This also needs better innovation as the race now changes to creating novel architectures rather than winning with more data.
&lt;br&gt;
Additionally, now there is a greater variety of data available to train these models including personal data - healthcare, financial data. This means better foundation models and more innovation in these underdeveloped areas.
&lt;br&gt;
Also, it means that the model is trained on individual devices, which implies that the computational and energy requirements are divided across devices, thus offloading the burden on the central server.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/crude/fed/fed1.png&#34; alt=&#34;federated learning&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;homomorphic encryption:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
in the current paradigm, this is how data encryption looks like during LLM inference:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://1rvinn.github.io/img/crude/fed/fed2.png&#34; alt=&#34;homomorphic encryption&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the inference is done on decrypted data, which leads to a loophole that can be exploited by cyber attackers. Not only this, but it can also lead to other security issues like the LLM learning about personal details and prompt injections as elaborated in [1].
&lt;br&gt;
homomorphic encryption prevents this by supporting calculations to be made on encrypted data itself, mitigating any data security threats.
&lt;br&gt;
additionally, being based upon lattice-based cryptography, it is resilient to the rise of quantum computers which pose a threat to existing encryption schemes like the RSA.
&lt;br&gt;
\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you notice, I have segregated the above problems into three categories - [D]: Democratization of AI, [P]: Privacy, [S]: Sustainability.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
these 3 issues are often always overlooked whenever there is a big innovation, but later, people realise the importance of working on these - the same happened in the case of Internet, with heavy spending on cybersecurity, sustainability and privacy being prevalent only these days.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
the above two frameworks can solve all these issues, empowering even a small startup from Maharashtra in India to compete with OpenAI based out of San Francisco. I truly believe this could be a revolutionary step for democratising AI development and boosting security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
