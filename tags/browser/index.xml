&lt;p&gt;i dont know why but recently i’ve been getting this urge to build a browser of my own. something that’s bespoke to my needs - has ai inbuilt, is junk free and everything is the way i want it. yeah maybe if it turns out to be amazing, i may plan on launching it but that’s for me to worry about later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i found this &lt;a href=&#34;https://browser.engineering/&#34;&gt;primer&lt;/a&gt; which is in and out of what a browser entails and how to build it on your own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;i found this &lt;a href=&#34;https://browser.engineering/&#34;&gt;primer&lt;/a&gt; which is in and out of what a browser entails and how to build it on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;doing a bit of research, i have realised that it is kinda hard to do it all from scratch, not only because it is going to be very long but also because of the compute inefficiency of the product you’ll get out with - very laggy, sucking all the juice out your ram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i could build it on top of chromium, but that wont teach me a lot about browsers and networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so i have decided to do neither and both at the same time. i’ll follow the primer, understand the basics right and then switch over to building over chromium, which i believe is also going to be imperative if i want to integrate ai into it — could be wrong, i dont really know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the best thing would still be to do it all from scratch, but let’s see where reading the primer leads me to and then make a decision likewise.&lt;/p&gt;
